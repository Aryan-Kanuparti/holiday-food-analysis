# Holiday Food Analysis : Recipes and Rating Dataset


### Investigation on Holiday Foods Versus Non-Holiday Foods in Terms of Nutrition and Ratings

Authors: Aryan Kanuparti


## Introduction

In most cultures, the holidays are a time to be grateful for what we have, cherish moments with family and friends, and, perhaps most importantly, enjoy delicious food. Holiday dishes often carry special significance, with recipes passed down through generations or designed to capture the festive spirit. However, the indulgent nature of holiday foods raises intriguing questions about their nutritional value and popularity. Do holiday recipes, often laden with sugar and fats, receive higher ratings simply due to the nostalgia and festive atmosphere, or do health-conscious individuals rate them lower because of their nutritional content?

This data science project, conducted at UCSD, investigates the relationship between a recipe's holiday food status—determined by whether it was posted between October and December—and its ratings and nutritional values. By analyzing datasets containing recipes and ratings posted on food.com since 2008, I aim to uncover trends that reveal how the festive season influences culinary preferences and perceptions.



The primary dataset, `recipes`, contains 83782 rows -- 83782 unique recipes -- with 12 columns recording the following information:

| Column             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| `'nutrition'`      | Nutrition information in the form [calories (#), total fat (PDV), sugar (PDV), sodium (PDV), protein (PDV), saturated fat (PDV), carbohydrates (PDV)]; PDV stands for “percentage of daily value” |
| `'n_steps'`        | Number of steps in recipe                                                                                                                                                                         |

| `'description'`    | User-provided description                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `'ingredients'`    | Text for recipe ingredients                                                                                                                                                                       |

The second dataset, `interactions`, contains 731927 rows with each one representing one review that a user left on a specific recipe. Each recipe could have multiple interactions and reviews. The columns it includes are:

| Column        | Description         |
| :------------ | :------------------ |
| `'user_id'`   | User ID             |
| `'recipe_id'` | Recipe ID           |
| `'date'`      | Date of interaction |
| `'rating'`    | Rating given        |
| `'review'`    | Review text         |


**Given the datasets, I am investigating whether people rate holiday recipes and non-holiday recipes similarly.** To answer this  question, I identified recipes submitted during the holiday season (October to December) and created a new column, 'is_holiday_season', to indicate whether a recipe falls into this category. Additionally, I extracted values from the 'nutrition' column into separate columns such as 'calories (#)', 'total fat (PDV)', 'sugar (PDV)', and others. 
Information  about these relationships could help contributors produce better recipes during the festive season. Additionally, these findings could lead to future work exploring how nutritional factors or seasonal sentiments influence ratings and preferences for holiday foods

## Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis

I followed this outline to clean and explore my data before getting into my testing and modeling.

1. Left merge the recipes and interactions datasets on id and recipe_id.

1. Fill all ratings of 0 with np.nan.

   - Ratings in this dataset range from from 1 to 5. 1 being the lowest rating and 5 being highest rating. Furthermore a rating of 0 does not really make sense with this scale, so to minmize bias I am going to fill all the 0 ratings with null values.
1. Add column `'average_rating'` containing average rating per recipe.

   - Since each recipe could potentially hae multiple rating from different users, aggregating all the ratings will help ii analyzing the trends associated with the rating of eah recipe.

1. Extract values in the nutrition column to individual columns of floats.

   - Based on the description of the columns of the recipe dataset, I know what each individual values inside the brackets of the nutrition columns means. In order to prerfom analysis with those values, I split up the nutrition list for each recipe and put those floats into thier own respective columns. 

1. Convert submittedv date column to datetime.

   - These two columns are both stored as objects initially, so we converted them into datetime to allow us conduct analysis on trends over time if needed.

1. Drop unused columns

   - I then dropped some columns that I decided I would not be using going forward, ['user_id', 'recipe_id'], recipe id is reduntant with id already being a column and the userid of who submitted the review bears no significance in this analysis

1. Add `is_holiday_season` to the dataframe
   - Added on a column of boolean values that represented whether each recipe was posted during a holiday month (October - December). False for recipes that were posted in the other nine months and true for the rest. I calculated this column using the clean datetime values in the submitted column.

#### Result
Here are all the columns of the cleaned df.

| Column                  | Description    |
| :---------------------- | :------------- |
| `'name'`                | object         |

| `'minutes'`             | int64          |
| `'contributor_id'`      | int64          |
| `'submitted'`           | datetime64[ns] |
| `'tags'`                | object         |

| `'review'`              | object         |

| `'total fat (PDV)'`     | float64        |
| `sugar (PDV)'`          | float64        |
| `'sodium (PDV)'`        | float64        |
| `'protein (PDV)'`       | float64        |
| `'saturated fat (PDV)'` | float64        |
| `'carbohydrates (PDV)'` | float64        |
| `'is_holiday_season'`   | bool           |



My cleaned dataframe ended with 234429 rows and 23 columns. Here are the first 5 rows of unique recipes ( there are some duplciated due to the initial left merge and the fact that each recipe could potentially have multiple differnt reviews and ratings) Since there is a lot of columns for the merged dataframe, we selected the columns that are most relevant to our questions for display.

Be sure to completely thaw the broccoli.  I didn&#039;t and it didn&#039;t get done in time specified.  Just cooked it a little longer though and it was perfect.  Thanks Chef.                                                                                                                                                     |            5 |          194.8 |                20 |             6 |             32 |              22 |                    36 |                     3 | False               |
